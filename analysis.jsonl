{"id":"ANALYSIS_001","title":"Value Archaeology Study Analysis - Technology Neutrality Assumption Validation","experimentIds":["EXP003"],"methods":"Systematic content analysis using assumption archaeology framework examining trait categorization, interface language, and default settings across 5 genetic selection platforms","findings":"100% of platforms embedded values (exceeding 80% success criterion), systematic bias patterns identified: Medical model bias (60%), Enhancement orientation (40%), Value-loaded language (60%), Average bias score 12.0/30","implications":"Technology neutrality assumption in genetic selection literature is empirically false. Genetic technologies inherently embed value systems requiring new governance paradigms that explicitly address technological values rather than assuming neutrality. Current bioethical frameworks become inadequate when technologies embed ethical frameworks.","limitations":"Sample limited to 5 mock platforms, focused on interface-level analysis rather than deeper algorithmic audit, temporal dimension not captured","nextSteps":"Scale validation with real-world platforms, longitudinal study of value evolution, user perception studies, cross-cultural validation, development of value-explicit design frameworks","createdDate":"2025-08-15T22:48:30.000Z"}
