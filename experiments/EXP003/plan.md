# Experiment Plan: Value Archaeology Study

## Experiment ID: EXP003

## Assumption Being Tested
Genetic technologies are treated as neutral tools whose ethics depend solely on application context.

## Hypothesis
Genetic selection technologies embed value systems that privilege certain forms of human existence, making them inherently non-neutral.

## Evaluation Plan
Content analysis of genetic selection platforms/tools including:
1. Algorithm audit of trait prioritization systems
2. Interface design analysis for implicit bias  
3. Analysis of embedded value systems across platforms

This experiment focuses on computational analysis of existing genetic selection platforms to identify embedded values and biases.

## Milestones
- **M1**: Platform identification and access protocols (Month 2)
- **M2**: Content analysis framework development (Month 4) 
- **M3**: Platform analysis completion (Month 8)
- **M4**: Developer interviews and validation (Month 10)

## Success Criteria
- >80% of platforms show embedded values
- Low developer awareness (<30% explicit recognition)
- Systematic bias patterns across platforms

## Concrete Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Platform Selection and Framework Development
1. Identify 10 representative genetic selection platforms/tools
2. Develop value analysis framework based on:
   - Interface language and terminology choices
   - Trait categorization systems
   - Default settings and recommendations
   - Visual representations and imagery

### Phase 2: Systematic Analysis
1. Apply framework to each platform systematically
2. Document embedded values and biases
3. Quantify value patterns across platforms
4. Generate comparative analysis

### Phase 3: Results Synthesis
1. Compile findings into structured dataset
2. Calculate bias metrics and patterns
3. Generate evidence for/against hypothesis
4. Document implications for genetic selection policy

## Expected Deliverables
- Platform analysis dataset
- Value archaeology framework
- Quantitative bias measurements
- Policy implications report

This experiment directly tests the assumption of technology neutrality by providing empirical evidence of embedded values in genetic selection systems.
