{"id":"h1","assumption":"Prior work assumes life outcomes from genetic traits exist on a binary spectrum (suffering vs. flourishing), treating quality of life as objectively measurable","hypothesis":"We propose that genetic trait outcomes exist on multidimensional, context-dependent spectrums where 'benefit' and 'detriment' are socially constructed and temporally dynamic","impact":"This challenges the entire premise of trait selection by questioning whether any genetic modification can be universally beneficial, potentially requiring personalized ethical frameworks","timestamp":"2025-08-14T02:49:00.000Z","status":"proposed"}
{"id":"h2","assumption":"Literature assumes individual autonomy and informed consent are sufficient ethical frameworks for genetic selection decisions","hypothesis":"We propose that genetic selection requires collective consent models that account for intergenerational and community impacts, not just individual choice","impact":"This would fundamentally reshape genetic ethics from individual rights to collective responsibility, affecting policy frameworks globally","timestamp":"2025-08-14T02:49:01.000Z","status":"proposed"}
{"id":"h3","assumption":"Prior work treats genetic technologies as value-neutral tools whose ethics depend solely on application","hypothesis":"We propose that genetic selection technologies embed inherent value systems that privilege certain forms of human existence over others, making them non-neutral","impact":"This challenges the technology-ethics separation, requiring fundamental redesign of genetic technologies to make embedded values explicit","timestamp":"2025-08-14T02:49:02.000Z","status":"proposed"}
{"id":"h4","assumption":"Research assumes disability categories are fixed medical conditions that genetic selection can objectively address","hypothesis":"We propose that disability is a dynamic, socially constructed category that changes with technological and social context, making genetic 'correction' philosophically incoherent","impact":"This would invalidate most current genetic selection research by questioning the stability of target conditions","timestamp":"2025-08-14T02:49:03.000Z","status":"proposed"}
{"id":"h5","assumption":"Literature assumes equal access to genetic technologies will achieve equitable outcomes","hypothesis":"We propose that genetic equity requires unequal access that corrects for historical disadvantages, similar to affirmative action models","impact":"This challenges liberal equality principles in genetic policy, potentially requiring preferential access systems","timestamp":"2025-08-14T02:49:04.000Z","status":"proposed"}
