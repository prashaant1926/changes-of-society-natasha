# Deaf Embryo Selection and Open Future Arguments

## Paper Analysis: Tubig (2023) - Is a deaf future an "Open" future?

### Citation
Tubig, P.A. (2023). Is a deaf future an "Open" future? Reconsidering the open future argument against deaf embryo selection. Monash Bioethics Review, 41, 175-195.

### Problem
Does selecting deaf embryos violate children's rights to an "open future" with maximum opportunities? The open future argument claims deafness limits opportunity ranges in ways that compromise future autonomy.

### Prior Assumptions
Prior work assumes:
- Deafness inherently limits opportunity ranges
- "Open future" can be objectively defined
- Autonomy is primarily individual rather than relational
- Deaf traits are inherently autonomy-diminishing

### Insight
**Key Innovation**: The "open future" argument fails because it relies on unjustified negative presumptions about deaf embodiments and neglects social/relational components of autonomy. Opportunity limitations stem from social barriers, not inherent traits.

### Technical Approach
Philosophical analysis examining:
- Different interpretations of "open future" concept
- Relationship between deafness and opportunity ranges
- Social vs. medical models of disability
- Autonomy as individual vs. relational capacity

### Evaluation
Theoretical ethical analysis. No empirical testing of autonomy outcomes for deaf vs. hearing individuals.

### Impact
**Relevance to Our Research**: Strongly supports our Assumption 4 hypothesis that disability categories are socially constructed rather than fixed medical conditions. Shows how genetic "correction" arguments rely on problematic assumptions about what constitutes improvement.

**Connection to Assumption 1**: Demonstrates that what counts as "benefit" (hearing) vs. "limitation" (deafness) depends heavily on social context rather than objective measures.

**Connection to Assumption 2**: Shows how individual autonomy frameworks fail to account for community and cultural identity factors in genetic selection decisions.
