# Genetic Enhancement Ethics

## Paper Analysis: Macpherson et al. (2019) - Ethical Challenges of Germline Genetic Enhancement

### Citation
Macpherson, I., Roqu√©, M.V., & Segarra, I. (2019). Ethical Challenges of Germline Genetic Enhancement. Frontiers in Genetics, 10, 767.

### Problem
How should society evaluate the ethical implications of germline genetic enhancement technologies that could fundamentally alter the human genome across generations?

### Prior Assumptions
Prior work assumes:
- Individual autonomy provides sufficient ethical framework for genetic decisions
- Benefits and risks of genetic modifications can be objectively measured
- Genetic technologies are ethically neutral tools
- Enhancement can be clearly distinguished from therapy

### Insight
**Key Innovation**: Germline genetic enhancement presents unique ethical challenges because modifications affect not just individuals but entire lineages, requiring new ethical frameworks that account for intergenerational impacts.

### Technical Approach
Systematic ethical analysis covering:
- Autonomy and consent challenges (including consent for future generations)
- Justice and equality implications
- Safety and risk assessment frameworks
- Societal impact considerations

### Evaluation
Theoretical analysis based on established bioethical principles. Limited empirical validation of proposed ethical frameworks.

### Impact
**Relevance to Our Research**: Supports our Assumption 2 hypothesis that individual autonomy is insufficient for genetic selection decisions. The paper demonstrates that genetic modifications require collective consent models due to intergenerational impacts.

## Paper Analysis: Veit (2018) - Procreative Beneficence and Genetic Enhancement

### Citation
Veit, W. (2018). Procreative Beneficence and Genetic Enhancement. Kriterion - Journal of Philosophy, 32(1), 75-92.

### Problem
If parents have obligations to choose children with the best possible lives (Principle of Procreative Beneficence), what are the moral implications for genetic enhancement?

### Prior Assumptions
Prior work assumes:
- "Best possible life" can be objectively determined
- Individual parental choice is the primary ethical framework
- Genetic modifications have predictable outcomes for well-being

### Insight
**Key Innovation**: Accepting procreative beneficence principles logically commits parents to genetic enhancement obligations, challenging the therapy/enhancement distinction.

### Technical Approach
Philosophical argument analysis using:
- Savulescu's Principle of Procreative Beneficence (PPB)
- Consequentialist principle comparing morally equivalent acts
- Logical extension from embryo selection to genetic modification

### Evaluation
Purely philosophical analysis using logical argumentation. No empirical testing of assumptions about genetic enhancement outcomes.

### Impact
**Relevance to Our Research**: Challenges our Assumption 1 about measurable benefit/harm spectrums by questioning who determines "best possible life" and whether such determinations can be objective or stable across contexts.
