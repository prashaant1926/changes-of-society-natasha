# Value Neutrality in Technology

## Paper Analysis: Hughes (1996) - Post-Humanist Defense of Genetic Engineering

### Citation
Hughes, J. (1996). Embracing Change with All Four Arms: Post-Humanist Defense of Genetic Engineering. Eubios Journal of Asian and International Bioethics, 6(4), 94-101.

### Problem
How can genetic engineering be ethically defended against both fundamental objections ("bio-Luddite" concerns) and pragmatic policy concerns ("gene-angst" arguments)?

### Prior Assumptions
Prior work assumes:
- Genetic technologies are inherently risky and potentially harmful
- Natural biological limits should be preserved
- Technology serves ruling class interests
- Genetic complexity makes engineering impossible

### Insight
**Key Innovation**: Genetic engineering objections fall into two categories - fundamental matters of faith vs. addressable policy concerns. A proactive regulatory framework can address pragmatic concerns while fundamental objections are matters of worldview.

### Technical Approach
Systematic categorization of objections:
- **Bio-Luddite arguments** (matters of faith): Medicine makes people sick, sacred natural limits, technology serves power, genome complexity
- **Gene-angst arguments** (policy addressable): Fascist applications, genetic diversity loss, geneticization, discrimination, bad parental decisions, disability discrimination, unequal access, declining solidarity

### Evaluation
Primarily theoretical analysis with policy proposals. Limited empirical validation of regulatory effectiveness claims.

### Impact
**Relevance to Our Research**: Challenges our Assumption 3 about technology value-neutrality by explicitly arguing technologies can be made beneficial through proper regulation, but doesn't address whether the technologies themselves embed values.

## Paper Analysis: Mikkelsen et al. (2019) - Genetic Protection Modifications

### Citation
Mikkelsen, R.B., Frederiksen, H.R.S., Gjerris, M., Holst, B., Hyttel, P., Luo, Y., Freude, K., & Sand√∏e, P. (2019). Genetic Protection Modifications: Moving Beyond the Binary Distinction Between Therapy and Enhancement for Human Genome Editing. CRISPR Journal, 2(6), 362-369.

### Problem
The binary therapy/enhancement distinction fails to capture important genetic interventions that could be life-saving but don't fit either category clearly.

### Prior Assumptions
Prior work assumes:
- Genetic interventions can be cleanly categorized as therapy (treating disease) or enhancement (improving normal function)
- Ethical evaluation depends primarily on this categorization
- Policy frameworks should be based on therapy/enhancement distinction

### Insight
**Key Innovation**: Introduction of "genetic protection modifications" as a third category for interventions that prevent future disease in otherwise healthy individuals (e.g., HIV resistance, BRCA1/2 modifications).

### Technical Approach
Case study analysis of:
- Sporadic Alzheimer's disease prevention
- BRCA1/2 mutation modifications for cancer prevention
- HIV resistance introduction

Each analyzed for fit within therapy/enhancement binary and proposed protection category.

### Evaluation
Conceptual analysis using specific medical examples. No empirical testing of policy implications or ethical frameworks.

### Impact
**Relevance to Our Research**: Supports our challenge to Assumption 1 about binary benefit/harm categories by showing genetic interventions exist on a spectrum that doesn't map neatly to traditional ethical categories.
