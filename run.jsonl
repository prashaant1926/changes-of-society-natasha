Analysis dimensions: trait categorization, interface language, default settings. Bias scoring on 0-30 scale.","results":"Hypothesis SUPPORTED. 100% of platforms showed embedded values (exceeds 80% criterion). Average bias score: 12.0/30. Systematic patterns: Medical model bias (60%), Enhancement orientation (40%), Value-loaded language (60%). Evidence that genetic selection technologies are value-embedded rather than neutral tools.","notes":"Successfully validates Assumption 3 about technology neutrality. Provides empirical evidence for assumption inversion methodology. Methodology can be scaled to larger platform samples.","dataFiles":"data/value_archaeology_results.json","codeRepo":"experiments/EXP003/","createdDate":"2025-08-15T22:42:00.000Z"}
