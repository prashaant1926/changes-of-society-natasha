## Core Research Hypothesis

**Assumption Inversion**: Prior work assumes genetic selection operates within stable, objective frameworks for benefit/harm, individual autonomy, and equitable access. **We propose that genetic selection inherently destabilizes these frameworks**, requiring fundamentally different ethical and technical approaches.

## Abstract

This research challenges five foundational assumptions underlying genetic selection literature: (1) that trait outcomes exist on measurable benefit/harm spectrums, (2) that individual consent suffices for ethical decision-making, (3) that genetic technologies are value-neutral tools, (4) that disability categories are medically fixed, and (5) that equal access ensures equitable outcomes. We propose that genetic selection technologies are inherently assumption-destabilizing systems that require new theoretical frameworks emphasizing contextual ethics, collective responsibility, explicit value systems, dynamic social construction, and corrective equity models. This paradigm shift could reshape genetic policy from optimization-focused to uncertainty-embracing approaches.

## 1. Problem Statement

The genetic selection field operates on assumptions that may be fundamentally incompatible with the technology's transformative effects. Current research assumes:
- **Stable benefit/harm categories** that genetic modification can objectively improve
- **Individual autonomy primacy** as the dominant ethical framework
- **Technology neutrality** where ethics exist separately from technical implementation
- **Fixed disability models** that provide clear modification targets
- **Liberal equality principles** where equal access produces fair outcomes, Edit made

**Core Research Question**: What if genetic selection technologies inherently undermine these foundational assumptions, requiring completely different ethical and technical frameworks?

## 2. Literature Assumptions Analysis

### Assumption 1: Binary Quality of Life Outcomes
**Literature Position**: Prior work treats genetic traits as existing on measurable spectrums from suffering to flourishing, enabling objective optimization decisions [1, 8].

**Our Challenge**: Trait outcomes are multidimensional, context-dependent, and temporally dynamic. What constitutes "benefit" shifts with technological capability, social acceptance, and individual circumstance.

### Assumption 2: Individual Autonomy Sufficiency  
**Literature Position**: Informed consent and individual choice provide adequate ethical frameworks for genetic selection decisions [6, 12].

**Our Challenge**: Genetic modifications affect intergenerational and community systems, requiring collective consent models that account for impacts beyond individual choice.

### Assumption 3: Technology Value Neutrality
**Literature Position**: Genetic technologies are treated as neutral tools whose ethics depend solely on application context [4].

**Our Challenge**: Genetic selection technologies embed value systems that privilege certain forms of human existence, making them inherently non-neutral.

### Assumption 4: Static Disability Categories
**Literature Position**: Disability represents fixed medical conditions that genetic selection can objectively address [9, 11].

**Our Challenge**: Disability is dynamically constructed through technological and social context, making genetic "correction" philosophically incoherent.

### Assumption 5: Equality Through Equal Access
**Literature Position**: Equitable outcomes result from equal access to genetic technologies across populations.

**Our Challenge**: Genetic equity requires unequal access that corrects for historical disadvantages and structural inequalities.

## 3. Research Direction & Impact

### Central Thesis
Genetic selection technologies function as **assumption-destabilizing systems** that transform the very frameworks used to evaluate them. This creates recursive challenges where ethical evaluation methods become inadequate precisely when the technology succeeds.

### Research Implications
1. **Theoretical Impact**: Challenges the foundation of genetic ethics by questioning stability assumptions
2. **Methodological Impact**: Requires new evaluation frameworks that embrace uncertainty and contextual variation  
3. **Policy Impact**: Suggests need for adaptive governance systems rather than fixed ethical guidelines
4. **Technical Impact**: Implies genetic technologies should explicitly surface embedded value systems

### Experimental Validation Framework
Our approach will test these assumption inversions through:
- **Contextual variation studies** examining how trait "benefits" shift across social/temporal contexts
- **Collective decision modeling** comparing individual vs. community consent frameworks
- **Value archaeology** in existing genetic technologies to surface embedded assumptions
- **Dynamic disability tracking** examining how modification targets change with social context
- **Equity intervention studies** comparing equal vs. corrective access models

This research direction positions genetic selection not as an optimization problem but as a **complex adaptive system** requiring fundamentally different analytical and ethical approaches.
