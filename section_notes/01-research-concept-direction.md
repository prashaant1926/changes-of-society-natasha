Abstract
The ethical and societal complexities of genetic selection involve critical debates surrounding disability, quality of life, and the risks of genetic homogenization. Proponents argue that genetic engineering could enhance human well-being by reducing traits linked to suffering. However, critics warn of potential discrimination and the reinforcement of social inequalities. Historical parallels to the eugenics movement highlight the dangers of defining genetic “normalcy,” while de- bates on the subjective nature of disability ques- tion assumptions about quality of life. Genetic diversity is essential for societal resilience, yet socioeconomic barriers restrict access to genetic technologies, presenting urgent ethical concerns. Navigating these challenges responsibly requires robust ethical safeguards, inclusive policies, and a deep appreciation for human diversity.

1 Introduction
The rapid advancement of genetic engineering has sparked intense discussions about its ethical and societal implications. At the core of these debates lies a fundamental question: how should society balance the promise of alleviating suffer- ing and enhancing human flourishing with the risks of perpetuating discrimination, undermin- ing diversity, and exacerbating social inequal- ities? Genetic selection, a key application of genetic engineering, offers the potential to ad- dress hereditary conditions and improve quality of life by reducing traits associated with suffer- ing. However, this potential raises complex eth-
ical questions about which traits should be al- tered and who has the authority to make such decisions [1, 8].
Historical parallels to the eugenics movement provide a cautionary framework for understand- ing the dangers of defining genetic "normalcy." Eugenic ideologies in the early 20th century led to widespread discrimination and the marginal- ization of specific communities based on their perceived genetic traits [4]. While contemporary genetic engineering often seeks to expand indi- vidual opportunities, the socioeconomic barriers limiting access to these technologies risk repli- cating patterns of inequity [6, 12]. Additionally, societal debates over the definitions of disabil- ity and quality of life highlight the complexity of determining which traits are worth altering [9, 11].
These ethical dilemmas underscore the impor- tance of addressing how genetic selection could marginalize specific communities, reinforce ex- isting biases, and constrain human diversity. As technological advancements progress, soci- ety must grapple with these critical questions to ensure the responsible development and equi- table application of genetic selection technolo- gies. By synthesizing insights from historical and contemporary debates, this review provides a framework for understanding the intersections of identity, diversity, and equity in the context of genetic selection.
