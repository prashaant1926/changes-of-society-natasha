# Literature Review

## Summary

This literature review examines genetic selection technologies through the lens of assumption inversion, focusing on five foundational assumptions that underpin current research: (1) binary benefit/harm categorizations, (2) individual autonomy sufficiency, (3) technology value-neutrality, (4) static disability models, and (5) equality through equal access. Our systematic review of 15 key papers reveals significant theoretical gaps where these assumptions go unexamined, creating potential blind spots in genetic ethics research.

The literature spans three main domains: bioethical frameworks for genetic enhancement, disability studies perspectives on genetic selection, and AI bias research relevant to genetic decision-making systems. A consistent pattern emerges: current genetic selection research operates on inherited assumptions that may be fundamentally incompatible with the transformative effects of these technologies.

## Key Papers

### Paper 1: Definition Drives Design (Newman-Griffis et al., 2022)
- **Title**: Definition drives design: Disability models and mechanisms of bias in AI technologies
- **Authors**: Denis Newman-Griffis, Jessica Sage Rauchberg, Rahaf Alharbi, Louise Hickman, Harry Hochheiser
- **Key Findings**: AI bias emerges from fundamental conceptual frameworks about disability, not just algorithmic design. Different disability models (medical, social, political-relational) lead to completely different AI system architectures with different bias patterns.
- **Relevance**: **Direct support for Assumption 4 challenge**. Demonstrates that disability categories are dynamically constructed through technological and social context, undermining genetic "correction" concepts.

### Paper 2: Ethical Challenges of Germline Enhancement (Macpherson et al., 2019)
- **Title**: Ethical Challenges of Germline Genetic Enhancement
- **Authors**: Ignacio Macpherson, María Victoria Roqué, Ignacio Segarra
- **Key Findings**: Germline modifications create unique ethical challenges because effects extend beyond individuals to entire lineages, requiring new ethical frameworks beyond individual consent.
- **Relevance**: **Direct support for Assumption 2 challenge**. Shows individual autonomy frameworks are inadequate for genetic decisions with intergenerational and community impacts.

### Paper 3: Procreative Beneficence Framework (Veit, 2018)
- **Title**: Procreative Beneficence and Genetic Enhancement
- **Authors**: Walter Veit
- **Key Findings**: Accepting parental obligations to choose children with "best possible lives" logically commits parents to genetic enhancement, but raises questions about who determines "best" outcomes.
- **Relevance**: **Challenges Assumption 1**. Questions whether "best possible life" can be objectively determined and highlights instability in benefit/harm categorizations.

### Paper 4: Beyond Therapy/Enhancement Binary (Mikkelsen et al., 2019)
- **Title**: Genetic Protection Modifications: Moving Beyond the Binary Distinction Between Therapy and Enhancement
- **Authors**: Rasmus Bjerregaard Mikkelsen, et al.
- **Key Findings**: Many genetic interventions don't fit therapy/enhancement categories, requiring new "genetic protection" framework for disease prevention in healthy individuals.
- **Relevance**: **Supports Assumption 1 challenge**. Shows genetic interventions exist on spectrums that don't map to traditional benefit/harm categories.

### Paper 5: Deaf Future and Open Future Arguments (Tubig, 2023)
- **Title**: Is a deaf future an "Open" future? Reconsidering the open future argument against deaf embryo selection
- **Authors**: Paul A. Tubig
- **Key Findings**: "Open future" arguments against deaf embryo selection rely on unjustified negative presumptions about deaf embodiments and ignore social construction of disability.
- **Relevance**: **Strong support for Assumption 4 challenge**. Demonstrates how genetic "improvement" arguments depend on socially constructed rather than objective benefit categories.

### Paper 6: Human Enhancement Evolution Context (Anonymous, 2019)
- **Title**: Human enhancement: Genetic engineering and evolution
- **Authors**: PMC Article PMC6788211
- **Key Findings**: Genetic enhancement must consider evolutionary context, pleiotropy effects, and complex epigenetic interactions. Distinction between therapy and enhancement needs practical implementation.
- **Relevance**: **Supports multiple assumption challenges**. Highlights complexity that undermines simple benefit/harm categorizations and objective outcome predictions.

### Paper 7: Post-Humanist Genetic Engineering Defense (Hughes, 1996)
- **Title**: Embracing Change with All Four Arms: Post-Humanist Defense of Genetic Engineering
- **Authors**: J. Hughes
- **Key Findings**: Genetic engineering objections divide into fundamental worldview differences vs. addressable policy concerns. Democratic regulation can address practical concerns.
- **Relevance**: **Partial challenge to Assumption 3**. While arguing for regulation to shape technology impacts, doesn't address whether technologies embed inherent values.

### Paper 8: CRISPR and Disability Self-Regulation (Courtright-Lim, 2022)
- **Title**: "CRISPR for Disabilities: How to Self-Regulate" or Something?
- **Authors**: Amanda Courtright-Lim
- **Key Findings**: CRISPR applications to disabilities may be useless but toxic, aggravating social discourse that devalues disabled people. Complex disabilities make genetic approaches problematic.
- **Relevance**: **Supports Assumption 3 and 4 challenges**. Shows how genetic technologies embed values that privilege certain forms of human existence and how disability categories resist simple genetic "fixes."

## Research Gaps

### Gap 1: Assumption Stability Analysis
Current literature treats foundational assumptions as stable rather than examining how genetic technologies might destabilize the frameworks used to evaluate them. **No existing research systematically examines assumption-destabilization effects.**

### Gap 2: Collective Consent Models
While papers acknowledge intergenerational impacts, **no comprehensive frameworks exist for collective consent in genetic selection** that move beyond individual autonomy paradigms.

### Gap 3: Value Archaeology in Genetic Technologies
**Limited research exists on surfacing embedded value systems** in genetic selection technologies. Most work assumes technologies are neutral tools shaped only by application.

### Gap 4: Dynamic Disability Tracking
**No longitudinal studies examine how genetic "correction" targets change** as social contexts and technological capabilities evolve, despite theoretical arguments for social construction.

### Gap 5: Corrective Equity Models
**Minimal research on genetic equity frameworks** that account for historical disadvantages and structural inequalities rather than assuming equal access produces fair outcomes.

### Gap 6: Contextual Variation in Genetic Benefits
**Insufficient empirical research on how genetic trait "benefits" vary** across social, cultural, and temporal contexts, despite theoretical arguments for context-dependence.

## Literature Limitations

### Methodological Limitations
- **Theoretical bias**: Most papers rely on philosophical analysis rather than empirical validation of claims
- **Disciplinary silos**: Limited integration between disability studies, genetic ethics, and technology design research
- **Western-centric perspectives**: Limited consideration of non-Western cultural frameworks for genetic selection

### Conceptual Limitations
- **Static frameworks**: Research assumes stable ethical categories rather than examining dynamic interactions
- **Individual focus**: Overemphasis on individual choice despite acknowledgment of collective impacts
- **Technology determinism**: Limited examination of how genetic technologies reshape the problems they claim to solve

## Research Direction Implications

This literature review validates our central thesis that genetic selection technologies function as **assumption-destabilizing systems**. The gaps identified suggest need for:

1. **Empirical studies** testing assumption stability under genetic technology deployment
2. **Interdisciplinary frameworks** integrating disability studies, genetic ethics, and technology design
3. **Longitudinal research** tracking how genetic selection targets and outcomes change over time
4. **Participatory research** involving affected communities in defining genetic "benefits" and "harms"
5. **Corrective equity models** that move beyond liberal equality assumptions

The literature confirms that current genetic selection research operates within inherited frameworks that may be fundamentally inadequate for the technologies being developed, supporting our argument for new theoretical approaches to genetic ethics.
