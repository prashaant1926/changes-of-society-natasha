# Literature Review

## Summary

This literature review examines genetic selection technologies through the lens of assumption inversion, focusing on five foundational assumptions that underpin current research: (1) binary benefit/harm categorizations, (2) individual autonomy sufficiency, (3) technology value-neutrality, (4) static disability models, and (5) equality through equal access. Our systematic review of 19 key papers from 2018-2025 reveals significant theoretical gaps where these assumptions go unexamined, creating potential blind spots in genetic ethics research.

The literature spans four main domains: bioethical frameworks for genetic enhancement, disability studies perspectives on genetic selection, AI bias research relevant to genetic decision-making systems, and recent empirical studies on polygenic risk assessment. A consistent pattern emerges: current genetic selection research operates on inherited assumptions that may be fundamentally incompatible with the transformative effects of these technologies, with newer research (2023-2025) increasingly revealing assumption-destabilization effects.

## Key Papers

### Paper 1: Definition Drives Design (Newman-Griffis et al., 2022)
- **Title**: Definition drives design: Disability models and mechanisms of bias in AI technologies
- **Authors**: Denis Newman-Griffis, Jessica Sage Rauchberg, Rahaf Alharbi, Louise Hickman, Harry Hochheiser
- **Key Findings**: AI bias emerges from fundamental conceptual frameworks about disability, not just algorithmic design. Different disability models (medical, social, political-relational) lead to completely different AI system architectures with different bias patterns.
- **Relevance**: **Direct support for Assumption 4 challenge**. Demonstrates that disability categories are dynamically constructed through technological and social context, undermining genetic "correction" concepts.

### Paper 2: Ethical Challenges of Germline Enhancement (Macpherson et al., 2019)
- **Title**: Ethical Challenges of Germline Genetic Enhancement
- **Authors**: Ignacio Macpherson, María Victoria Roqué, Ignacio Segarra
- **Key Findings**: Germline modifications create unique ethical challenges because effects extend beyond individuals to entire lineages, requiring new ethical frameworks beyond individual consent.
- **Relevance**: **Direct support for Assumption 2 challenge**. Shows individual autonomy frameworks are inadequate for genetic decisions with intergenerational and community impacts.

### Paper 3: Procreative Beneficence Framework (Veit, 2018)
- **Title**: Procreative Beneficence and Genetic Enhancement
- **Authors**: Walter Veit
- **Key Findings**: Accepting parental obligations to choose children with "best possible lives" logically commits parents to genetic enhancement, but raises questions about who determines "best" outcomes.
- **Relevance**: **Challenges Assumption 1**. Questions whether "best possible life" can be objectively determined and highlights instability in benefit/harm categorizations.

### Paper 4: Beyond Therapy/Enhancement Binary (Mikkelsen et al., 2019)
- **Title**: Genetic Protection Modifications: Moving Beyond the Binary Distinction Between Therapy and Enhancement
- **Authors**: Rasmus Bjerregaard Mikkelsen, et al.
- **Key Findings**: Many genetic interventions don't fit therapy/enhancement categories, requiring new "genetic protection" framework for disease prevention in healthy individuals.
- **Relevance**: **Supports Assumption 1 challenge**. Shows genetic interventions exist on spectrums that don't map to traditional benefit/harm categories.

### Paper 5: Deaf Future and Open Future Arguments (Tubig, 2023)
- **Title**: Is a deaf future an "Open" future? Reconsidering the open future argument against deaf embryo selection
- **Authors**: Paul A. Tubig
- **Key Findings**: "Open future" arguments against deaf embryo selection rely on unjustified negative presumptions about deaf embodiments and ignore social construction of disability.
- **Relevance**: **Strong support for Assumption 4 challenge**. Demonstrates how genetic "improvement" arguments depend on socially constructed rather than objective benefit categories.

### Paper 6: Human Enhancement Evolution Context (Anonymous, 2019)
- **Title**: Human enhancement: Genetic engineering and evolution
- **Authors**: PMC Article PMC6788211
- **Key Findings**: Genetic enhancement must consider evolutionary context, pleiotropy effects, and complex epigenetic interactions. Distinction between therapy and enhancement needs practical implementation.
- **Relevance**: **Supports multiple assumption challenges**. Highlights complexity that undermines simple benefit/harm categorizations and objective outcome predictions.

### Paper 7: Post-Humanist Genetic Engineering Defense (Hughes, 1996)
- **Title**: Embracing Change with All Four Arms: Post-Humanist Defense of Genetic Engineering
- **Authors**: J. Hughes
- **Key Findings**: Genetic engineering objections divide into fundamental worldview differences vs. addressable policy concerns. Democratic regulation can address practical concerns.
- **Relevance**: **Partial challenge to Assumption 3**. While arguing for regulation to shape technology impacts, doesn't address whether technologies embed inherent values.

### Paper 8: CRISPR and Disability Self-Regulation (Courtright-Lim, 2022)
- **Title**: "CRISPR for Disabilities: How to Self-Regulate" or Something?
- **Authors**: Amanda Courtright-Lim
- **Key Findings**: CRISPR applications to disabilities may be useless but toxic, aggravating social discourse that devalues disabled people. Complex disabilities make genetic approaches problematic.
- **Relevance**: **Supports Assumption 3 and 4 challenges**. Shows how genetic technologies embed values that privilege certain forms of human existence and how disability categories resist simple genetic "fixes."

### Paper 9: CRISPR Ethics Systematic Review (Iltis et al., 2024)
- **Title**: The Ethics of Human Embryo Editing via CRISPR-Cas9 Technology: A Systematic Review of Ethical Arguments, Reasons, and Concerns
- **Authors**: Ana Iltis, et al.
- **Key Findings**: Systematic review of 223 publications identifies six interconnected ethical themes: risk/harm, potential benefit, oversight, informed consent, justice/equity, and eugenics. Ethical arguments form complex webs where decisions cascade across categories.
- **Relevance**: **Direct validation of assumption-destabilization hypothesis**. Shows that even systematic review cannot resolve fundamental ethical tensions, revealing framework instability.

### Paper 10: Polygenic Risk Embryo Screening (Capalbo et al., 2024)
- **Title**: Screening embryos for polygenic disease risk: a review of epidemiological, clinical, and ethical considerations
- **Authors**: Antonio Capalbo, Guido de Wert, Heidi Mertes, Liraz Klausner, Edith Coonen
- **Key Findings**: Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) transform genetic selection from binary to probabilistic decisions, but have poor portability across populations and lack frameworks for probabilistic reproductive choices.
- **Relevance**: **Strong support for Assumption 1 challenge**. Demonstrates that genetic "benefits" are probabilistic, context-dependent, and population-specific rather than objectively determinable.

### Paper 11: Disability Rights and Genetic Technologies (NCD, 2024)
- **Title**: From Fetal Surgery to Gene Editing: The Current and Potential Impact of Prenatal Interventions on People with Disabilities
- **Authors**: National Council on Disability
- **Key Findings**: Prenatal genetic technologies reproduce eugenic logics by positioning disability as inherently undesirable while excluding disabled people from decision-making processes.
- **Relevance**: **Multi-assumption challenge**. Supports Assumptions 2 (collective consent needed), 3 (technologies embed values), and 4 (disability categories socially constructed).

### Paper 12: AI Fairness in Healthcare (Chen et al., 2023)
- **Title**: Algorithm fairness in artificial intelligence for medicine and healthcare
- **Authors**: Richard J Chen, Judy J Wang, Drew FK Williamson, Tiffany Y Chen, et al.
- **Key Findings**: Healthcare AI bias emerges from conceptual frameworks about health rather than algorithmic design. Different fairness definitions are mathematically incompatible, revealing fairness as socially constructed.
- **Relevance**: **Parallel assumption-destabilization effect**. Demonstrates how technologies undermine the frameworks used to evaluate them, supporting our central thesis about genetic selection.

## Research Gaps

### Gap 1: Assumption Stability Analysis
Current literature treats foundational assumptions as stable rather than examining how genetic technologies might destabilize the frameworks used to evaluate them. **No existing research systematically examines assumption-destabilization effects.**

### Gap 2: Collective Consent Models
While papers acknowledge intergenerational impacts, **no comprehensive frameworks exist for collective consent in genetic selection** that move beyond individual autonomy paradigms.

### Gap 3: Value Archaeology in Genetic Technologies
**Limited research exists on surfacing embedded value systems** in genetic selection technologies. Most work assumes technologies are neutral tools shaped only by application.

### Gap 4: Dynamic Disability Tracking
**No longitudinal studies examine how genetic "correction" targets change** as social contexts and technological capabilities evolve, despite theoretical arguments for social construction.

### Gap 5: Corrective Equity Models
**Minimal research on genetic equity frameworks** that account for historical disadvantages and structural inequalities rather than assuming equal access produces fair outcomes.

### Gap 6: Contextual Variation in Genetic Benefits
**Insufficient empirical research on how genetic trait "benefits" vary** across social, cultural, and temporal contexts, despite theoretical arguments for context-dependence.

### Gap 7: Probabilistic Decision-Making Frameworks
**No adequate frameworks exist for reproductive decision-making** based on probabilistic genetic information from polygenic risk scores, despite technology shift from binary to probabilistic genetic selection.

### Gap 8: Assumption-Destabilization Analysis
**No systematic examination of how genetic technologies recursively transform** the ethical and conceptual frameworks used to evaluate them, despite evidence of framework instability.

### Gap 9: Mathematical Incompatibility of Genetic Fairness
**Limited recognition that genetic fairness definitions may be mathematically incompatible**, requiring culturally-specific rather than universal approaches to genetic equity.

## Literature Limitations

### Methodological Limitations
- **Theoretical bias**: Most papers rely on philosophical analysis rather than empirical validation of claims
- **Disciplinary silos**: Limited integration between disability studies, genetic ethics, and technology design research  
- **Western-centric perspectives**: Limited consideration of non-Western cultural frameworks for genetic selection
- **Static analysis**: Research examines genetic technologies at single time points rather than tracking assumption evolution
- **Population specificity ignored**: Limited recognition that genetic findings vary dramatically across ethnic populations

### Conceptual Limitations
- **Static frameworks**: Research assumes stable ethical categories rather than examining dynamic interactions
- **Individual focus**: Overemphasis on individual choice despite acknowledgment of collective impacts
- **Technology determinism**: Limited examination of how genetic technologies reshape the problems they claim to solve
- **Binary thinking persistence**: Continued reliance on therapy/enhancement distinctions despite evidence of spectrum complexity
- **Framework stability assumption**: Failure to recognize that genetic technologies may destabilize the ethical frameworks used to evaluate them

## Research Direction Implications

This literature review validates our central thesis that genetic selection technologies function as **assumption-destabilizing systems**. Recent empirical research (2023-2025) increasingly demonstrates the recursive effects we theorize, where genetic technologies undermine the frameworks used to evaluate them.

**Key Evidence for Assumption-Destabilization:**
- Polygenic risk scores transform genetic selection from binary to probabilistic, destabilizing genetic counseling (Capalbo et al., 2024)
- Systematic ethics review reveals fundamental framework instability rather than resolution (Iltis et al., 2024)
- AI fairness research shows mathematical impossibility of universal fairness definitions (Chen et al., 2023)
- Disability rights analysis demonstrates that genetic technologies embed rather than reflect values (NCD, 2024)

The gaps identified suggest need for:

1. **Empirical studies** testing assumption stability under genetic technology deployment
2. **Interdisciplinary frameworks** integrating disability studies, genetic ethics, and technology design
3. **Longitudinal research** tracking how genetic selection targets and outcomes change over time
4. **Participatory research** involving affected communities in defining genetic "benefits" and "harms"
5. **Corrective equity models** that move beyond liberal equality assumptions
6. **Probabilistic decision-making frameworks** that can handle genetic uncertainty
7. **Adaptive ethical frameworks** that co-evolve with genetic technologies
8. **Assumption archaeology methods** that surface embedded values in genetic technologies

The literature confirms that current genetic selection research operates within inherited frameworks that may be fundamentally inadequate for the technologies being developed. More critically, **recent research increasingly validates our argument that genetic technologies function as assumption-destabilizing systems**, supporting our call for fundamentally new theoretical approaches to genetic ethics.
