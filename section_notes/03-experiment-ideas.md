# Experiment Ideas

## Overview

Our experimental approach follows the Computer Science-inspired research methodology to test the core assumption inversions identified in our genetic selection research. Each experiment is designed to empirically validate our hypothesis that genetic selection technologies are **assumption-destabilizing systems** that undermine their own evaluation frameworks.

### Experimental Strategy
1. **Direct Assumption Testing**: Each experiment targets specific assumptions from the literature
2. **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: Experiments examine contextual, temporal, and cultural variations
3. **Empirical Validation**: Use quantifiable metrics while acknowledging the limitations of measurement
4. **Recursive Framework Testing**: Assess how experimental results change the evaluation criteria themselves
